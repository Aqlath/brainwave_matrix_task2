# ✈️ Airline Tweets Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Introduction

This project is part of my **internship in Data Science and Analytics**. The goal is to perform **sentiment analysis** on airline tweets to identify whether customer feedback is **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**. Using a labeled dataset, I cleaned the data, analyzed the sentiment polarity, and created meaningful visualizations to gain insights.

## 🧠 Background

Social media platforms, especially Twitter, serve as a major source of real-time customer feedback. Airline companies can gain valuable insights by analyzing the sentiment of tweets directed at them. This helps in:

- Understanding customer satisfaction levels.
- Identifying pain points or service failures.
- Improving engagement and service quality.

## 🛠 Tools I Used

- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating charts and graphs.
- **TextBlob**: To calculate polarity of the tweets.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For writing and running the code.
